 A tracker for Castlevania 2 Randomizer built using Godot Engine.
Still under heavy development.

# Implemented so far:
* Map overlay
* Toggle buttons for items
* Whip/crystal upgrades work as they should
* Barebones notepad

# In progress:
* Add checks to the map
* Add drag-and-drop functionality for item icons to note which check has them
